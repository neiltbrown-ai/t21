    "program_description": "Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides monthly cash payments ($994 in 2026) to families with limited income caring for a child with a qualifying disability. For children with Down syndrome, this is often the foundational benefit that also unlocks Medicaid coverage.\n\nDown syndrome (non-mosaic Trisomy 21) automatically qualifies through the Compassionate Allowances program, which expedites processing and may provide presumptive payments within days while the claim is reviewed. These payments can continue for up to 6 months without requiring repayment if ultimately denied.\n\nBeyond the monthly cash payment totaling $11,928 annually, SSI recipients automatically qualify for Medicaid in most states, providing comprehensive health coverage often worth $15,000-$50,000+ per year in therapy, medical care, and equipment.",

If approved, receive back payments from application date\n7. Complete annual renewals and periodic medical reviews (disability status rarely changes for Down syndrome)\n8. Report any changes in income, living arrangements, or resources\n\nCRITICAL: At age 18, parental income and assets no longer count. Many families denied due to parent income should reapply when their child turns 18, evaluating only the young adult's own financial situation. Most adults with Down syndrome qualify at this point.",

Even families earning $50,000-$60,000 may qualify depending on family size and deductions.\n\nThe real value often isn't the cash payment but the Medicaid coverage, which provides unlimited therapy (PT, OT, speech), medical equipment, and comprehensive healthcare without copays or deductibles. Private insurance typically caps therapy at 20-30 visits annually, while children with Down syndrome often need weekly sessions indefinitely.\n\nFor families denied initially due to parent income: Don't give up. Mark your calendar for your child's 18th birthday and reapply immediately. The rules completely change, and approval rates are extremely high for adults with Down syndrome since parental finances are no longer considered.\n\nSome families worry that receiving SSI will \"label\" their child or limit future opportunities. In reality, SSI has no bearing on educational services, employment prospects, or adult independence. It's simply a financial support that can be discontinued at any time if circumstances change.",

    "program_description": "The Katie Beckett/TEFRA program is a Medicaid option that disregards parental income when determining a child's eligibility for Medicaid. This is transformative for middle and upper-income families whose children have significant medical or developmental needs but who don't qualify for traditional Medicaid due to parent earnings.\n\nNamed after Katie Beckett, whose situation in 1981 revealed a policy inequity (children in institutions got Medicaid regardless of parent income, but identical children at home were denied), this program allows children requiring institutional-level care to receive Medicaid while living at home, counting only the child's own income (typically $0).\n\nAvailable in 18 states plus DC, this program has no waitlist and is an entitlement, making it crucial for families earning $75,000-$200,000+ who face substantial medical costs that insurance doesn't fully cover.",

Contact state Medicaid office or Katie Beckett program directly\n3. Submit application (online or paper depending on state)\n4. Provide documentation:\n   - Medical records showing therapy needs, supervision requirements, medical complexity\n   - Healthcare provider letters supporting \"institutional level of care\" determination\n   - Child's income information (typically none)\n   - Proof of child's assets (typically minimal)\n5. Complete clinical assessment - evaluator will assess child's needs to determine if they meet \"institutional level of care\" criteria\n6. Await determination (2-6 months depending on state)\n7. If approved, enroll in Medicaid managed care plan (where applicable)\n8. Complete annual redetermination\n\nKEY: Children with Down syndrome typically meet \"level of care\" criteria due to therapy requirements, developmental needs, and supervision needs. Focus documentation on demonstrating these needs clearly.",

    "real-world_context": "Katie Beckett/TEFRA is the single most important program for middle and upper-income families with children with Down syndrome. A family earning $150,000 annually can have their child receive full Medicaid benefits, accessing unlimited therapy, medical equipment, and healthcare without depleting savings.\n\nMany families don't realize they qualify or are intimidated by the \"institutional level of care\" language. This doesn't mean your child needs to be severely disabled or medically fragile. It means they need services comparable to what would be provided in a facility setting. Most children with Down syndrome meet this through therapy needs alone\u2014speech therapy 2-3x weekly, OT weekly, PT weekly, plus developmental services easily constitutes institutional-level support.\n\nUnfortunately, only 18 states plus DC currently offer this program. If your state doesn't participate, advocate for its adoption. Contact state legislators, disability advocacy organizations, and Medicaid offices to request implementation. Several states have added Katie Beckett in recent years following parent advocacy campaigns.\n\nFor families in participating states who were previously denied traditional Medicaid due to income, this program is life-changing. The annual value of unlimited therapy and medical coverage can easily exceed $30,000-$50,000, far more than most families could afford to pay out-of-pocket.",

    "real-world_context": "DAC is the most under-applied-for benefit. Many families don't know it exists or assume their adult child only qualifies for SSI. Reality: Most adults with Down syndrome whose parent worked qualify for DAC, and it's usually better than SSI. The benefit can be substantially higher ($1,200-$1,800 vs. $994 for SSI), has no asset limits (enabling savings), and provides Medicare. Apply as soon as parent begins receiving Social Security retirement (typically age 62-67) or if parent receives SSDI. The marriage restriction is significant\u2014DAC benefits generally terminate upon marriage, though some exceptions exist. For dual-eligible individuals (getting both SSI and DAC), the SSI amount is reduced but Medicaid continues, and Medicare is added, creating excellent combined coverage.",
